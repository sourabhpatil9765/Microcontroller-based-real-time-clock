digital clock

Digital clock displays the time using numbers. This circuit is used in many applications like cars, railway stations, houses, offices, etc. in order to provide accurate time and date. In this type of applications, normally we use RTC (Real Time Clock) ICs to display the time and date accurately. This circuit displays the time on LCD. For this clock, we can set the time at any instant. Here the clock works in 24 hour mode and the RTC chip is configured by programming 8051 controller.
